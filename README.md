## Project Summary
A popular YouTuber approached our team seeking guidance on effectively managing their channel. Their primary goals were to minimise subscriber loss, enhance viewer retention, and maximise their return on investment (ROI) through both ad revenue and premium subscriptions. To achieve these objectives, we discussed strategies such as optimising content for engagement, analysing viewer demographics to tailor uploads, and employing effective marketing techniques to promote exclusive content for premium members. By focusing on fostering a loyal community and delivering consistent value, the YouTuber aims to build a sustainable and profitable channel while creating meaningful connections with their audience.

## Top 3 insights
The day of the week that exhibits the highest levels of engagement, measured by likes, shares, and comments, is Tuesday. Analysis indicates that two seasons, specifically spring and winter, experience minimal churn, characterised by a churn probability of less than 0.3. Conversely, the remaining two seasons demonstrate a moderate churn probability, ranging from greater than 0.5 to not exceeding 0.8. Channel growth experienced an upward trajectory over the first three years, reaching its zenith in 2018, while the retention rate remained stable from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic until 2024.

Factors influencing churn include the publishing season, with summer and fall showing the lowest retention rates. Additionally, the day of the week plays a significant role, as both Tuesday and Sunday are associated with heightened interaction with content. This increased engagement subsequently leads to a high revenue per 1,000 views, with Tuesday generating revenue of $8.04 and YouTube ad revenue amounting to $1,150. Furthermore, August is identified as the month with the least churn, attributed to the majority of school seasons being in recess during this period.
