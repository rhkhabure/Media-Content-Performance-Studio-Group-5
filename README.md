## Project Summary
A popular YouTuber approached our team seeking guidance on effectively managing their channel. Their primary goals were to minimise subscriber loss, enhance viewer retention, and maximise their return on investment (ROI) through both ad revenue and premium subscriptions. To achieve these objectives, we discussed strategies such as optimising content for engagement, analysing viewer demographics to tailor uploads, and employing effective marketing techniques to promote exclusive content for premium members. By focusing on fostering a loyal community and delivering consistent value, the YouTuber aims to build a sustainable and profitable channel while creating meaningful connections with their audience.

## Presentation Detail
The dashboard compromises of a churn analysis page on the 'HomePage' and an engagement page for monitoring engagement and how it affects revenue over time. Both pages can be viewed on either a laptop or a mobile device.
